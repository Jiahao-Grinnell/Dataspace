			<br>
			<h4>Farmers throughout the world face complex challenges. To deliver quality crops to market, farmers need to consider the multiple growing conditions:</h4>
			<li>Soil appropriate to the plants, possibly modified with fertilizer</li>
			<li>Fresh air, especially carbon dioxide</li>
			<li>The correct amount of sunlight and water</li>
			<li>Pesticides, herbicides, and treatments for plant diseases</li>
		
			<h4>For example, to make a profit, farmers need to decide if they should purchase and apply fertilizer or install an irrigation system. They also need to consider the long-term effects on the environment. A farmer’s challenges do not end with the harvest: changing market conditions may mean that the farmer cannot recover the season’s costs, resulting in a financial loss.</h4>
			<h4>The Greenhouse Game allows players to grow and sell crops in a virtual greenhouse. It follows the process of planning, planting, growing, harvesting, and selling crops that farmers follow with each growing season. While players can choose any options they like, they are more likely to earn a profit if they use interactive graphs and statistical models to improve their strategies. Here are some key terms each player should know:</h4>
		
			<li><strong>Yield</strong> is the amount of crops produced. It is measured by the number of bushels produced for each plot. In this game, yields reflect actual crop growth in Iowa farmland.</li>
			<li>A <strong>bushel</strong> originally was a large basket used to carry crops. For example, a bushel of corn typically weighs about 56 pounds.</li>
			<li><strong>Water</strong> is the amount of water (in inches) that you assign to each plot.</li>
			<li>A <strong>plot</strong> is the area of ground where you are planning your seeds. In this Greenhouse game, each test plot represents 1/10th of an acre of land.</li>
			<li>The game will ask you for a <strong>Player ID</strong>. You can use any name you like, but this will be on the internet, so do not use a name that will easily identify you.</li>
			<li>If you are playing this game for a course, your instructor will provide a <strong>Group ID</strong> so you will be able to compete with everyone in your class.</li>

		<div class="partsButton" style="width:80%">Part B: Collecting Data</div>
		<h4  style="width:80%;margin:auto;padding-top:10px;font-size:20px">The Greenhouse Game can also be an opportunity to consider a variety of research questions, such as what combination of growing conditions would optimize crop yields or profits? Most real-world research questions are much bigger than the resources available to study them, and researchers must limit the scope of their efforts. Similarly, we will start with a simplified question. We will <strong>estimate the corn yield based on the amount of water</strong>.</h4>	
		<h4>Use the Greenhouse game (below) to collect data on corn yield based on the amount of water:</h4>
		<li>Provide a <strong>Player ID</strong> (see Figure 1). You may use any name you like: this name will be on the internet, so do not use a name that will easily identify you.</li>
		<li>Provide a <strong>Group ID</strong>. If you are playing this game for a course, use the exact Group ID provided by your instructor, which is the same for every person in the class.</li>
		<li>Select <strong>Level 1.</strong></li>
		<li>On the next screen, note the prices of corn ($30 for each plot) and water ($1 for every inch of water added to each plot).</li>
		<li>Select <strong>corn</strong>; enter the six amounts of water as you see in Figure 2; test every combination 5 times; and then select <strong>Randomized Play</strong>, which assigns each treatment (crop type and water amount) to a randomly selected plot.</li>

		<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: At this point, do not worry about winning or profits; just carefully follow the instructions below to collect data.</p>
		<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: If you are unable to play the game, either try a different browser or go to the game website directly 	<a href="https://www.stat2games.sites.grinnell.edu/games/greenhouse.html">here.</a></p>

		<p style = "font-family: Georgia;font-size:18px; line-height: 1.65">After you select <strong>Randomized Play</strong>, you will be able to:</p>
		<br>
		<li style="padding-left:0px; font-size:18px; margin-left: 20px">  Move your cursor over each plot to identify the crop type and the amount of water the plot has received.</li> 
		<br>
		<li style="padding-left:0px; font-size:18px; margin-left: 20px">  Click the <strong>Harvest</strong> button on the right. Then click <strong> Sell All</strong> to sell your crops. The game will display how much profit you made. <strong>Remember the profit</strong> for your first season.</li>
		<br>
		<li style="padding-left:0px; font-size:18px; margin-left: 20px"> Click the <strong>Data Graph</strong> to see the data you collected. Based on this graph, consider which amount of water is best.</li>
