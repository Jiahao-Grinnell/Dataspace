		<br>
		<h4>Ronnie is headed home after a day of school. He’s got a spring in his step as he makes his way through his
			Brooklyn neighborhood. As he reaches for his keys, he gets a sinking feeling, realizing he left them on the
			kitchen table. He shuffles past the bushes and cups his hands to look into the first-floor window, checking
			to see if his younger sister is home yet. As he’s fumbling with the front door, two men come up and gruffly
			ask him what he’s doing.</h4>
		<h4>They flash their badges and tell him they’re going to search him, based on his suspicious behavior.
			Tongue-tied, Ronnie tries to explain the situation as one man starts rifling through his backpack, and the
			other one pats him down. Even though he didn’t do anything wrong, his heart is pounding, and his palms start
			to sweat.</h4>
		<h4>After several minutes, the cops conclude that Ronnie’s story checks out, and they head down the street,
			leaving Ronnie to wonder just how much of that interaction had to do with the color of his skin.</h4>
		<h4>The New York City stop-and-frisk policy allowed police to stop and search individuals when any officer had
			"reasonable suspicion" — a standard that is lower than the "probable cause" needed to justify an arrest. The
			logic was that when nonviolent crime rates are reduced, <a
				href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna33230464">violent crime rates</a> go down as well. <a
				href="https://www.cantonrep.com/story/news/2009/10/24/police-frisking-policy-credited-with/42545329007/">NYPD
				Commissioner Raymond Kelly stood by the policy</a>, stating that “This is a proven law enforcement
			tactic to fight and deter crime, one that is authorized by criminal procedure law.”</h4>
		<h4>Civil rights activists, such as the <a
				href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/frisk9.pdf">Center for Constitutional
				Rights</a>, argued that this stop-and-frisk policy led to the New York City Police Department (NYPD)
			unfairly targeting people of color. Recent New York leaders such as Mayor Bill de Blasio made changes to
			that policy, decreasing the frequency of stop-and-frisks happening on a daily basis. Does the data provide
			evidence that Black and Latinx people are policed differently than white people?</h4>

		<div class="partsButton" style="width:50%;margin-left:25%">Part 1B: What Does The Data Say?</div>
		<h4>The data we are working with comes from the <a
				href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/stopfrisk.page">New York City Police
				Department</a>. Every time a person is stopped or questioned by the NYPD, an officer is expected to fill
			out a police report that records the details of the interaction. Since 2002, there were more than <a
				href="https://www.nyclu.org/data/stop-and-frisk-data">five million stop-and-frisk reports</a>. However,
			large amounts of data don’t necessarily lead to clear conclusions. Let’s take a look at just how easy it is
			to draw incorrect conclusions from large and messy data sets.</h4>
		<h4>The graphs in Figure 1 below visualize the same data from these reports, but in two different ways.</h4>
		<br><br>
	</div>


	<section id="leftContent" style="width:25%;float:left;height:2000px;text-align:center;line-height: 1.7">
		<div style="width:80%;float:left;color:Black;font-size: 16px; text-align: left; margin-left:5%">
			<p> <strong>Figure 1A</strong></p>
			<p>Shows the <strong>total number</strong> of arrests broken down by race of the suspect. This graph clearly
				tells the story that people of color are much more likely to be arrested than white people. </p>
		</div>
		<div style="width:80%;float:left;color:Black;font-size: 16px; text-align: left; margin-left:5%">
			<br>
			<p> <strong>Figure 1B</strong></p>
			<p>Displays the <strong>percentage of people stopped</strong>, who were arrested for each race. When we
				focus only on people who have already been stopped, there is no longer a clear racial disparity in the
				percentage of those people who are then arrested; (number of people arrested)/(number of people stopped)
				for each race is similar.</p>

		<br><br>
		<h4>By considering Figures 1A and 1B, we see an example of how two people could reasonably tell two different
			stories depending on the way they summarize the data.</h4>
		<h4>Whenever we are shown a percentage, we should always ask the question, “Percentage of what?” From Figure 1A,
			it appears that about 50% of all arrests made in New York under the stop-and-frisk policy involve a Black
			person being arrested. This is consistent with previous research that found that from January 1998 through
			March 1999, Black and Hispanic people represented 51% and 33% of the individuals stopped by the NYPD, even
			though only 26% and 24% of the population of New York City is Black or Hispanic, respectively.5 Figure 1B
			answers a different question for each race: given that a person has been stopped, what percentage of those
			stops result in the person being arrested? The core issue is that the values chosen can be mathematically
			accurate but lead to very different conclusions.</h4>
		<br><br>

		<div class="partsButton" style="width:50%;margin-left:25%">Part 1C: Explore The Data</div>
		<h4>It’s one thing to study a graph, but you can really understand the nuance and complexity of the data when
			you manipulate it yourself! See if you can use the NYPD Bar Chart App to recreate Figure 1A and Figure 1B on
			your own. Then modify the graph to answer the questions below.</h4>

			<p style="margin-left:40px">Before we make any conclusions about a graph or dataset, it is important to ask
				critical questions to determine if the data is trustworthy. How would you evaluate the data in the NYPD
				Bar Chart App </p>
			<div style="margin-left:10px">
				<br>
				<h4>a) What is the source?</h4>
				<div style="text-indent:30px">
					<li>Where is this data coming from?</li>
					<li>What is the purpose of this information? Would this source have any desire to influence how

					</li>
					<li>Does this data agree with other sources?</li>
				</div>
				<br>

				<h4>b) What’s the context?</h4>
				<li>What measurements are we most interested in? Is it reasonable to assume that the available data can
					be used to address our questions?</li>
				<li>Are the numbers saying something about an entire population or just a restricted subset of a
					population?</li>
				<li>How was the data collected? It is reasonable to assume that the data was accurately recorded?</li>
				<li>Is there any missing data, missing context, or missing information that we need to consider?</li>
				<li>What do other studies show?</li>
				<br>
				<h4>c) What assumptions are we making? It can be very easy to produce biased results even with reliable
					data.</h4>
				<li>How can we be sure that we are not simply using the data to support what we want to be true? Are we
					incorporating some of our own personal assumptions when drawing conclusions from this data?</li>

		<section class="discussionSubsection">
			<h3><strong>Part 1F: Get Curious</strong><img src="images/GetCurious.jpg" width="35" height="32"

			<p>1. Which graph should be used to better understand the possible patterns of discrimination in the NYPD,
				Figure 1A, 1B, or both? Briefly describe how each graph can contribute to addressing Focus Question 1.
				How does the story change if both graphs are used?</p>
			<p>2. Why is it important to consider the racial distribution of the entire city when looking at these
				graphs?</p>
			<p>3. When is it important to look at multiple graphs before drawing conclusions from a dataset?</p>
			<p>4. In each report, a suspect is identified by the police as male, female, or unknown. Are there any clear
				patterns related to the gender of the suspect? Assuming a male was stopped, is he more likely to be
				arrested than a female? Do these patterns hold true across races? (Hint: try faceting by race.)</p>
			<p>5. Which crime type tends to have the most arrests each year?</p>
			<p>6. Develop your own question that could be answered with the above NYPD Bar Chart app. Write a one
				paragraph answer to your question.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Assume your audience already understands the source and context of the data.</li>
				<li>Include one or two graphs (cut and pasted from the app above).</li>
				<li>Clearly state your question, describe the variables in the graph(s), interpret your graph(s), and
					discuss what conclusions you are able to draw from these graphs.</li>
